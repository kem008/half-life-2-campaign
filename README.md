Half-Life 2 Campaign 1.26 was an addon for an old Garry's Mod which doesn't work in Garry's Mod 13. I decided to try port this gamemode for Garry's Mod 13 to see the outcome and I must say, I'm quite happy with it. I worked on this so hard to fix old bugs and bring it back from the death.

** Please give all credits to AMT since he was the one who originally made this gamemode, He just simply ported it D4UNKN0WNM4N2010 and me continued the gamemode to make it work for the future.
